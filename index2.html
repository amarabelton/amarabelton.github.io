			GeoCities made a very big mark on the
			 visual culture of the internet in the 90â€™s.
			  With gif, funky texts and fun backgrounds.
				GeoCities were not unique for making a platform
				 for people to make their own website, it was
				 unique in the way they started the idea of
				 networking. Linking people through neighborhoods
				  while have  a very simple drag and drop method
					for the development of the webpage. GeoCities
					 started the idea of publishing oneself online
					  to connect different communities. It was heavily
						 based on the users imagination and creativity,
						 which as a result has left a legacy for fun and
						  interesting websites that people can look back
							on in a nostalgic way. To an extent were
							GeoCities were archived by Olia Lialina.
							 Old GeoCities users can go back and recall
							 the days of publishing online with absolute
							  freedom to be creative and present oneself
								 in the most authentic way.
