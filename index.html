			Opportunity, also known as MER-B <span>(Mars Exploration Rover â€“ B)</span> or MER-1, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics">robotic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_(space_exploration)">rover</a> that was active on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">Mars</a> from 2004 to 2018.[2] Launched on July 7, 2003, as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover">Mars Exploration Rover</a> program, it landed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridiani_Planum">Meridiani Planum</a> on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)">Spirit</a> <span>(MER-A)</span> touched down on the other side of the planet.[7] With a planned 90 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols">sol</a> duration of activity <span>(slightly more than 90 earth days)</span>, Spirit functioned until getting stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while Opportunity was able to stay operational for 5352 sols after landing, exceeding its operating plan by 14 years, 294 days <span>(in Earth Time)</span>, 55 times its designed lifespan. By June 10, 2018, when contact was permanently lost during a global dust storm,[8][9] the rover had traveled a distance of 45.16 kilometers <span>(28.06 miles)</span>.[6]

			Mission highlights included the initial 90 sol mission, finding extramartian meteorites such as Heat Shield Rock <span>(Meridiani Planum meteorite)</span>, and over two years of exploring and studying Victoria crater. The rover survived less severe dust-storms and in 2011 reached Endeavour crater, which has been described as a "second landing site".[10]
		</p>

		<p>
			Due to the 2018 dust storms on Mars, Opportunity ceased communications on June 10 and entered hibernation on June 12, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once the atmosphere cleared,[11] but it did not, suggesting either a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust has covered its solar panels. NASA hoped to reestablish contact with the rover, citing a windy period that could potentially clean off the solar panels of the rover.[12] On February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the Opportunity mission was complete, after the spacecraft failed to respond to repeated signals sent since August 2018.[13]
